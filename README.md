# USGS Earthquakes

This code pulls all earthquakes from the past 7 days from the USGS database and plots them on a map using Leaflet.  The size and color of the marker correlate to the magnitude of the earthquake.  Fault lines are also mapped.  To run this code, you will need to create your own config.js file with an API_KEY field with a leaflet API key.
